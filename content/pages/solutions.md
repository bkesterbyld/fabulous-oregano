      **Supply Chain**


      Supply chain professionals and 3PLs use bitdomains to establish visibility
      and control of orders and inventory across complex supply networks,
      avoiding antiquated and slow FTP, EDI and other batch loading approaches,
      ultimately making better real-time decisions and satisfying end-customers

      IT Directors use bitdomains to provide trial data access while evaluating
      new software solutions and running conference room pilots


      **Application & API Consolidation**


      Product management leaders who are responsible for multiple software
      products love using bitdomains to create a unified API for customers, or
      to build new applications on top of legacy products.


      **Agency Collaboration**
