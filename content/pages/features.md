      Bitdomains are next generation virtualized computing spaces that operates
      independently of the server infrastructure they run against. In many use
      cases, bitdomains are more scalabe for real-time, disparate transactional
      data processing than any custom system. They blend several key features
      into a holistic, easy and hyper-scalable computing experience


      *   Data modeling and mapping to source systems is via familiar tables,
      while supporting JSON and document-based concepts. Data can be fully
      relational.

      *   We use PostgreSQL, Cassandra and various object stores from cloud
      providers to handle storage, but you don't have to know anything about
      those technologies or interact with them, bitdomains take care of that for
      you. 

      *   No code logic agents give you query and data management capability
      along with the power of imperative programming languages like Java and C.
      Logic agents are housed in a bitdomain but can operate on other
      bitdomains. They execute based on events such as a data update or form
      submission. They can also execute based on timers to generate reports and
      near-real time analytics. 

      *   Parallel, in-memory and edge processing available via no code logic
      agents can process massive, disparate data sets, often in sub-second
      timeframes

      *   You can create and position our equivalent of a  [materialized
      view](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialized_view) across the world.
      Views can live on memory or on disk.

      *   The system constantly generates unique API identifiers for data
      tables, fields and logic commands to provide granular security

      *   Via a robust access control system, business people and data
      scientists can login to view, search and download data based on granular
      permissions
