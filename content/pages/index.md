          Rapidly model the data you want to share between parties with easy no
          code tools. Then transfer data into a Bitdomain via API or our
          integration platform partners. Behind the scenes, we put this
          intermediate data in safe and economical SQL, NoSQL and object stores
          in a multicloud network. You can keep the data in a bitdomain for as
          long as you need.

          Create no code logic agents that transform, aggregate and analyze data
          in real-time. They act based on events, or can run on timers to create
          period analytics and reports.

          Data sets can be replicated for different data consumers and put
          wherever needed globally. Each consumer gets unique API key access,
          browser access or both. Granular security options include controlling
          access by data subsets, fields and by time windows. API keys can even
          be granted for a specific piece of data or to invoke logic and data
          manipulations.
