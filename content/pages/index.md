          Create no code logic agents that transform, aggregate and analyze data
          in real-time. They act based on events, or can run on timers to create

          Data sets can be replicated for different data consumers and put
          wherever needed globally. You can select from granular API key options
          including controlling access by data sets, fields, logic agents and by
          time windows. You can even grant an API key for a specific piece of
          data.
