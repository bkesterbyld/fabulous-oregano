The bitdomain team pioneered the IoT market, where we lived at the intersection of massive data, disparate parties and real-time decision-making. As our customer's sensor networks grew, their data management complexity increased exponentially, and started flirting with the edges of computer science. We kept trying to get off-the-shelf technologies to solve this intersection economically, but nothing worked. We broke both open source tech and advanced products from companies like Oracle, SAP and IBM. So we took a page from VMware and thought, what if we virtualized infrastructure away? And then what if we make it distributed? And hence, bitdomains were born.

The core technology of bitdomains is safe, reliable and extremely secure. It's proven with several confidential customers and at companies like HPE, Tesla, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, BAE Systems and Northrup Grumman.

The company is based in the Bay Area and is backed by prominent Silicon Valley investors and family offices.
