    title: 'Easy, Secure and Infinitely Scalable'
    content: >
      Bitdomains are next generation virtualized computing spaces that operates
      independently of the server infrastructure they run against. In many use
      cases, bitdomains are more scalabe for real-time, disparate transactional
      data processing than any custom system.


      They blend several key features into a holistic, easy and hyper-scalable
      computing experience


      **Multidata modeling and mappings to source systems**


      Create no code data, fully relational tables that also support
      document-based modeling for JSON-type data. 


      **Data management with a visual programming language**


      No code logic agents give you query and data management capability along
      with the power of imperative programming languages like Java and C. 


      **Powerful compute options to handle intense transformations, calculations
      and business logic**


      Parallel, in-memory and edge processing  process massive, disparate data
      sets, often in sub-second timeframes


      **Bespoke, globally distributed data views for each data consumer**


      Create and position the equivalent of a  [materialized
      view](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialized_view) across the world,
      cutting down partner queries and delivering instant data response to them.


      **Unmatched, granular API access control**


      The system constantly generates unique API identifiers for data tables,
      fields and logic commands to provide granular securityâ€”even actual data
      can have it's own API identifier.


      **Accessible to business people and data scientists**


      Via a robust access control system, business people and data scientists
      can login to view, search and download data based on granular permissions
