      **Supply Chain**


      Supply chain professionals and 3PLs use bitdomains to establish
      intercompany visibility and control of orders and inventory across complex
      supply networks.


      **Tech Vendor Evaluation**


      IT Directors use bitdomains to provide trial data access while evaluating
      new software solutions and running conference room pilots.


      **Application & API Consolidation**


      Product management leaders who are responsible for multiple software
      products use bitdomains to create a unified API for customers, or to build
      new applications on top of legacy products.


      **Agency Collaboration**


      e-commerce leaders use bitdomains to get data to external agencies who
      develop and maintain corporate web and marketing sites that need company
      back office or customer data.


      **GDPR and Privacy Compliance**


      Application owners and data engineers use bitdomains to keep sensitive
      data in required countries, while replicating non-sensitive data back to
      master sets.
