The bitdomain team pioneered both the No Code and IoT markets, and saw some of the world's most extreme, multi-party computing situations as a result. We kept trying to get off-the-shelf technologies to solve the intersection of different parties with disparate data, but ended up breaking both open source tech and advanced products from companies like Oracle, SAP and IBM. So we took a page from VMware and thought, what if we virtualized all this? And hence bitdomains were born.

The core technology of Bitdomains is safe, reliable and extremely secure and proven with several confidential customers and at companies like HPE, Tesla, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, BAE Systems and Northrup Grumman.
