    title: 'Easy, Secure and Infinitely Scalable'
    content: >
      Bitdomains are next generation virtualized computing spaces that operates
      independently of the server infrastructure they run against, abstracting
      away data from physical storage and networks.  This makes them immune to
      an array of traditional intrusion vectors. And Bitdomains scale
      infinitely, so we take the load off your own infrastructure while
      mitigating potential DDoS attacks.


      From a single bitdomain, you can replicate and segment data down to
      granular levels to give internal and external data consumers only what
      they need—nothing more, nothing less. Bitdomains blend several key
      features into a holistic, secure approach to internal and external data
      exchange:


      **Multidata modeling and mappings to source systems**


      Create no code, fully relational data models that support structured,
      unstructured and file data. Bitdomains are ACID-compliant for
      transactional data and we put everything in mature and reliable SQL, NoSQL
      and object stores behind the scenes across various cloud providers.


      **Data management with a visual programming interface**


      No code logic agents give you query, manipulation and calculation
      capability as powerful as imperative programming languages like Java and
      C.


      **Powerful compute options to handle intense transformations, calculations
      and business logic**


      Parallel, in-memory and edge compute process massive, disparate data sets,
      often in sub-second timeframes


      **Bespoke, globally distributed data views for each data consumer**


      Create and position the equivalent of a [materialized
      view](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialized_view) across the world,
      cutting down custom queries and delivering instant data response to end
      users and clients


      **Granular API access control**


      The system constantly generates unique API identifiers for data tables,
      fields and logic commands to provide granular security—even actual data
      can have it's own API identifier.


      **Accessible to business people and data scientists**


      Via a robust access control system, business people and data scientists
      can login to access, search and replicate data based on granular
      permissions


      **Developers can directly power applications off the API**


      Bitdomains can act as a full-featured backend for your data consumers,
      they just add their own business logic to the data you share via the
      native toolset.


      **Centralized cataloging, monitoring and control**


      Bitdomain platform admins can manage unlimited bitdomains for their
      organization and enjoy full control and monitoring of all data.
